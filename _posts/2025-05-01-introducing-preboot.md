Today, we're excited to announce the first public release of PreBoot, a comprehensive framework for Java developers building SaaS applications. After months of development and testing, we're proud to share this project with the developer community.

## Why We Built PreBoot

Building SaaS applications in Java often means reimplementing the same patterns over and over:

- Multi-tenancy for serving multiple customers
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Event-driven architectures for scalability
- Data access patterns like CQRS
- Frontend components tailored for SaaS UIs

We found ourselves repeating these implementations across projects, and we knew there had to be a better way. That's why we created PreBoot - to provide a solid foundation for SaaS applications so developers can focus on their unique business logic instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Core Features

PreBoot comes with several key features that make SaaS development faster and more reliable:

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

PreBoot provides built-in support for multi-tenancy with multiple implementation strategies:

```java
@Configuration
public class MultiTenancyConfig {
    @Bean
    public TenantDatabaseConfig tenantDatabaseConfig() {
        return TenantDatabaseConfig.builder()
            .withStrategy(TenantDatabaseStrategy.SEPARATE_SCHEMA)
            .withSchemaPrefix("tenant_")
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization

Comprehensive auth system with JWT support, OAuth2 integration, and role-based access control:

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityModule securityModule() {
        return SecurityModule.builder()
            .withJwt()
            .withOAuth2Providers("google", "github")
            .withRoleBasedAccess()
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

A complete event system for building reactive applications:

```java
@Component
public class OrderCreatedEventHandler implements EventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent> {
    @Override
    public void handle(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        // Handle the event
    }
}

// Publishing events
eventBus.publish(new OrderCreatedEvent(orderId));
```

### CQRS Implementation

Clean separation of commands and queries for better scalability:

```java
// Command
@Value
public class CreateProductCommand implements Command {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private BigDecimal price;
}

// Command Handler
@Component
class CreateProductCommandHandler implements CommandHandler<CreateProductCommand> {
    @Override
    public void handle(CreateProductCommand command) {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Query
@Value
public class GetProductsQuery implements Query<List<ProductDto>> {}

// Query Handler
@Component
class GetProductsQueryHandler implements QueryHandler<GetProductsQuery, List<ProductDto>> {
    @Override
    public List<ProductDto> handle(GetProductsQuery query) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

Want to try PreBoot? Getting started is simple:

1. Add the dependency to your Spring Boot project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.preboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>prebootkit-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Configure the main components:

```java
@Configuration
public class PreBootConfig {
    @Bean
    public PreBootKit preBootKit() {
        return PreBootKit.builder()
            .withMultiTenancy()
            .withAuthentication()
            .withEventBus()
            .withTaskQueue()
            .build();
    }
}
```

3. Start building your SaaS application!
