    <h1>PreBoot.io - Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Thank you for your interest in contributing to PreBoot.io (the "Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") clarifies the terms under which You, the person or entity identified below, may make Contributions to the Project. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project, its users and authors ("Us" or "We").
    </p>

    <p class="agreement-notice">
      <strong>By submitting a Contribution, You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions. If You are accepting on behalf of an entity, You represent that You are authorized to bind that entity to this Agreement.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>

    <p><strong>"You"</strong> (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

    <p><strong>"Contribution"</strong> shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work. A Contribution does not include any work that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."</p>

    <p><strong>"Project"</strong> shall mean the PreBoot.io project and any related software, documentation, or other materials managed by Us.</p>

    <h2>2. Grant of Copyright License</h2>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.</p>

    <h2>3. Grant of Patent License</h2>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Representations</h2>
    <p>You represent that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(a)</strong> You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Us.</li>
      <li><strong>(b)</strong> Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that You have sufficient rights to grant the licenses herein.</li>
      <li><strong>(c)</strong> You will identify any material portion of Your Contribution that is not Your original work and is subject to a third-party license, and provide Us with complete and accurate information regarding such third-party license terms and any restrictions associated with it.</li>
      <li><strong>(d)</strong> To the best of Your knowledge, Your Contribution does not include any malicious code, viruses, or other harmful components.</li>
    </ul>
